= DDD Examples based on Spring PetClinic Sample Application

== Origin

Derived from link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic[Spring PetClinic Sample Application]

== Philosophy

* don't want to muddle the original repo
* not intend to provide a silver bullet
* not intend to demostrates how to write tests
* only to provide examples 
* minimal maintenance effort

== Baseline changes compared to original code

* removed gradle
* removed all tests as original tests are no longer relevant
* removed all Active Record style codes
* removed all check style
* removed all Hibernate Inheritance Mapping
* chnaged all fetching strategies to LAZY
* removed all cascade strategies
* removed uses of `WebDataBinder`, `Validator`, and `@ModelAttribute` annotation at method level
* applied PRG pattern
* applied some basic error messages
* applied packages to apply some level of layering
* applied Spring Data Repository for each jpa entity

== How to use

* download the repo
* compare the four projects

== Project Structures

Rewritten from Orginal to a typical Layered example.

|A lazy but "good enough" DDD Architecture Example. 

Minimal personal favoured changes from layered example to achieve isolation

[Notes]
====
* Everything in a `domain` package, including sub packages, together is a Domain Model. An object like the `Pet` object alone is NOT the Domain Model but an object model inside a Domain Model

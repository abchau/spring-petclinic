= Spring PetClinic Sample Application: additional examples on Layered, Hexagonal and DDD (Clean/Onion)

== Origin

Derived from link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic[Spring PetClinic Sample Application]

== Objectives

* not to muddle with the original repo
* not intend to provide a silver bullet
* not to provide "production ready" code
* not intend to demostrates how to write tests
* minimal maintenance effort

== Major changes compared to original

* removed gradle
* removed check style
* removed all tests
* removed all Active Record style codes
* removed all Hibernate Inheritance Mapping
* chnaged all fetching strategies to LAZY
* removed all cascade strategies
* removed uses of `WebDataBinder`, `Validator`, and `@ModelAttribute` annotation at method level
* reorganised packages
* applied PRG pattern
* added some basic error messages
* added archiecture tests

== How to use

. download the repo
. read and understand the original structure in link:spring-petclinic-org[] or the original repo at link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic[]
. compare link:spring-petclinic-org[] with the changes in link:spring-petclinic-layered[]
. compare link:spring-petclinic-layered[] with the changes in link:spring-petclinic-layered-hex[]
. compare link:spring-petclinic-layered[] with the changes in link:spring-petclinic-layered-ddd[], link:spring-petclinic-layered-clean[] and link:spring-petclinic-layered-onion[]

|Layered Architecture Example 

Rewritten from Orginal to usually how people approach traditional Layered Architecture. This is not the only form of traditional Layered Architecture.

|link:spring-petclinic-layered-hex[]
|Yes
|Driving -> Application <- Driven
a|Hexagonal Architecture™ Example

Rewritten from Layered Architecture Example

|link:spring-petclinic-layered-ddd[]
|Yes
|User Interface -> [Application -> Domain] <- Infrastructure
|DDD Architecture™

Rewritten from Layered Architecture Example 

|link:spring-petclinic-layered-clean[]
|Yes
|User Interface -> [Application -> Domain] <- Infrastructure
|Clean Architecture™ Example

Rewritten from Layered Architecture Example.

Please note that this is an example of "Clean Architecture™", not "clean architecture". 

"Clean Architecture™" is the architecture and exmaple deescribed in the book Clean Architecture™. 

"clean architecture" is more like using general English to describe an architecture that anyone can come up with and self-proclaimed as "an architecture that is clean". 

|link:spring-petclinic-layered-onion[]
|Yes
|User Interface -> [Application -> Domain] <- Infrastructure
|Onion Architecture™ Example

[Notes]
====
* In DDD, everything in a `domain` package, including sub packages, together is a Domain Model. An object like the `Pet` object alone is NOT the Domain Model but a domain object inside a Domain Model
